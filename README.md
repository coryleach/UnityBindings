> This is a library of binding components that allow you to quickly wire data sources to target properties via the inspector.</br></br>
> Binding changes propagate via the System.ComponentModel.INotifyPropertyChanged interface but the included binding components will also refresh their target properties in OnEnable.</br></br>
> A general purpose ComponentBinding monobehaviour is included to wire any two UnityEngine.Objects together as well as a TextBinding for quick and simple binding to text fields.

## Quick Package Install

#### Using UnityPackageManager (for Unity 2019.3 or later)
Open the package manager window (menu: Window > Package Manager)<br/>
Select "Add package from git URL...", fill in the pop-up with the following link:<br/>
https://github.com/coryleach/UnityBindings.git#1.0.2<br/>

#### Using UnityPackageManager (for Unity 2019.2 or earlier)
Find the manifest.json file in the Packages folder of your project and edit it to look like this:
```js
{
  "dependencies": {
    "com.gameframe.bindings": "https://github.com/coryleach/UnityBindings.git#1.0.2",
    ...
  },
}
```

## Usage

```C#
//Bindings can be created in code as follows
//Currently all bindings are one way from source to target
var binding = new Binding();

//If your source implements INotifyPropertyChanged correctly changes will automatically propagate
binding.SetSource(myData,"SourcePropertyName");
binding.SetTarget(myView,"TargetPropertyName");

//You can also force a refresh (unnecessary if source implements INotifyPropertyChange)
binding.Refresh();

//Temporarily disable bindings
binding.Enabled = false;

//Set a custom converter to transform source values before they are passed to the target
binding.Converter = (x) => x.ToString();

//Destroy the Binding
binding.Dispose(); 
```
